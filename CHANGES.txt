libunittest (3.6.0) stable; urgency=low

  * removed 'has_timed_out' as an XML attribute of tag 'testcase'
  * added new attribute 'assertions' to tag 'testcase' which is filled
    with the assertion that triggered the failed test
  * only those attributes of tag 'testcase' are displayed that are provided
    with information, e.g., classname doesn't show up if there is no class name
  * tests that were skipped didn't show up in the output XML. Now they do
    and are marked with the empty tag 'skipped'
  * added macro UNITTEST_LOGTEXT (or shortcut LOGTEXT) which can be used
    to provide further information about the current test -> see examples
  * all info passed to LOGTEXT is forwarded to stdout in case of errors
    or failures
  * all info passed to LOGTEXT is forwarded to the output XML and 
    appears under the new tag 'system-out'
  * unittest::deps had the wrong type -> changed it to double
