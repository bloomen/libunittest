libunittest (7.0.0) stable; urgency=low

  * !!! This version changes various names and function/class interfaces !!!
  	-> Do not use it if you're not ready to migrate
  * Add command line option -u to pass the name of the test suite
  * Add noexcept(false) to ~testcase() which ensures that exceptions
  	can be handled that may be thrown by destructors in derived classes
  * Improved string representation of numbers and bools in assertions
  * Fixed bug apparent on VS2013 where the file name and line number were not
  	parsed correctly from UNITTEST_SPOT
  * Renamed run macros with context from *_RUNCXT to *_RUNCTX
  * Renamed internals namespace to core
  * Use of std::shared_ptr in classes and functions within random namespace
  	-> see example: random
  * Add a clone method to all classes in the random namespace
  * The test context now needs to be passed in as a std::shared_ptr
  	-> see example: flexible
  * Improved argument parsing
  * Better documentation

libunittest (6.0.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug: The duration of the test suite was not displayed correctly
  	if the suite consisted of only one test that is skipped
  * The test context is now only passed around as a pointer right from
  	the main entry point: unittest::testrun() Since an interface change
  	was necessary the major version number was incremented.
  	However, this should not affect any regular users since
  	the macro interfaces stayed the same.
  * Renamed class collection_child to a safer name to avoid conflicts
  * Add -Wextra and -Weffc++ to g++ and clang++ flags and fixed
  	all resulting warnings
  * Better documentation

    by adding: using unittest::fail.
  * Added two new command line options (-l, -r) to control display behavior

    appears under the new tag 'system-out'
